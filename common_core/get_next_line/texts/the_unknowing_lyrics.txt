I never lied about those times
That I felt free
From the outside everything
Seemed so easy
Yet I can't help but worry
I've been here before
I thought I'd closed the door
But here you are

It's in my blood it's in my heart
Been in my veins right from the start
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control
It's been so hard to keep this up
Been traveling far to fill my cup
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control

I never choked upon those words
You threw at me
Yet they still lingered in my head
For centuries
It's the unknowing
That keeps me up at night
I'm only asking for a sign
Were we ever right?
Were we ever right?
Hey!

It's in my blood it's in my heart
Been in my veins right from the start
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control
It's been so hard to keep this up
Been traveling far to fill my cup
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control

It's in my blood it's in my heart
Been in my veins right from the start
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control
It's been so hard to keep this up
Been traveling far to fill my cup
Don't know I have a fear of the unknown
Until I start to lose control

Overstimulated
There's no telling when this feeling
Wants an ending
Oh, so captivated
By the way you looked at me
And said I'd find it
